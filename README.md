# Yara — The open-source multi-tool Discord Bot

Yara is an Open-Source Discord Bot that can and will help you moderate your server on Discord and keep it safe from unwanted people. No unfortunately we are not as sophisticated as a Discord Bot such as Wick, but Yara has some handy features for you and they are all free to use!

## Before you continue reading

> Yara is built using the command manager [reciple](https://github.com/thenorthsolution/Reciple) and [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), please go ahead and give them some credit as this would not have been possible without them!

## Information

Yara currently is under construction. Yes how unfortunate for you! However, soon Yara will be released to you, the public, in good time.

Yara uses [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com), a MySQL-type database, to store information and the [Object-relational-mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object–relational_mapping), [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
